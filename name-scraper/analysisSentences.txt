{"nameSentences":["You are attracted to working outdoors in nature, where you would experience the peace and serenity you so much desire.","You would find electricity, electronics, and similar technical fields of interest, as well as computer, mathematical, and scientific studies.","You are inclined to be quiet, reserved, patient, and conservative, preferring to test and prove everything to your own satisfaction before committing yourself.","You like to finish what you start without interruptions, and also to have everything in its place and properly organized.","You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing turmoil and unhappiness.","Finding it difficult to join in light conversation with those with whom you are not well acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative.","As a result, you seem aloof.","Your limited verbal expression--except with those involved in your field of interest--makes it difficult for you to communicate your deeper thoughts even to those closest to you.","Friendships and personal association are accordingly restricted, as well as business success, because you are over-cautious in venturing into financial risks or promotional effort.","You can be creative, inventive, and ingenious in practical matters, such as handicrafts.","When you have the opportunity to pursue your own goals and interests free from interference, you can feel very agreeable and express a buoyant optimism.","On the other hand, you can be impulsive and forceful when opposed, and act without due forethought and discretion.","Hence you have many bitter experiences and generally rather unsettled conditions in your life, with little progress and financial accumulation.","You cannot tolerate any domination by others, or circumstances that restrict your freedom and independence.","You are inclined to make changes abruptly in your life as an escape from such conditions.","When annoyed or offended, you can be very candid and sarcastic in your speech.","Many disruptions in friendship and association have thus resulted.","Verbal expression is difficult for you, and you can be forthright in situations requiring delicacy, even though it is not your intention to be.","You are serious-minded and not inclined to make light of things even in little ways, and in your younger years you had more mature interests than others your age.","Home and family mean a great deal to you and it is natural that you should desire the security of a peaceful, settled home environment where you can enjoy the companionship of family and friends.","Whatever you set out to accomplish you do your very best to complete in accordance with what you consider to be right.","In the home you assume your responsibilities capably, having the self-confidence to form your own opinions and make your own decisions.","Others can rely on you; once you have given your word you will do your utmost to fulfil a responsibility.","However, there is a tendency to be a little too independent in your thinking and it is difficult for you to accept the help of others when you should.","In a large group of comparative strangers, you are quiet and rather shy, unable to express yourself, not really wanting to become involved in conversation.","On the other hand, among friends with whom you feel at ease, you are expressive, witty, and quite charming.","These contrasting natures make it difficult for people to understand you and can lead to friction in your personal life.","You are deep, philosophical, and refined, but your extremely sensitive nature causes you to become depressed and self-pitying over any real or imagined slight.","If you are not careful, people take advantage of your generous nature.","You find the beauties of nature, fine music, art, and literature--all the deeper things of life--inspiring.","The reserved, sensitive side of your nature brings aloneness and friction into your life, although you crave affection and understanding.","Your ideas can be very original and inventive.","You enjoy being with people in a social environment.","Your personal appearance is important to you, for you desire to make a good impression on others.","Your pleasant manner attracts people to you with their problems and you are capable of offering practical advice, though you would probably not follow such advice yourself.","This name causes you to be somewhat too concerned with the personalities, problems, and activities of other people.","You seem positive and decisive and can be outspoken in the expression of your opinions, but you lack the self-confidence needed to follow through with your ideas and plans.","Procrastination is your downfall.","You frequently choose the path of least resistance to avoid your responsibilities.","It is not easy for you to overcome obstacles or face issues.","This name does you an injustice in that it restricts your success in business and personal pursuits through a lack of ambition.","Yours is a versatile, musical, artistic, but independent nature and you must have the freedom to express your creative ideas and abilities to be happy.","An urge for independence causes dissatisfaction and frustration in close relationships and you find the \"ties that bind\" restricting.","The qualities of this name would find a more constructive outlet in work that involves high-pressure selling or promotional activities, possibly in community affairs, for it contains a positive, driving power.","It is difficult for you to merge with others; although you have quickness of mind, you lack tolerance and can give way to impatience at another's slowness or shortcomings.","If you cannot complete your plans when you wish to do so, you could suffer intense moods of depression and extreme sensitivity in the region of the solar plexus, resulting possibly in ulcers or nervous disorders.","This name could take you into bitter experiences through impulsive action.","However, there is a tendency to assume too heavy a burden of responsibility for others, which leads to worry and undue concern.","People with problems are drawn to you as they recognize you as one who has understanding and gives not only sympathy and comfort but provides also some constructive advice or assistance.","You have a generous quality to your nature, but you must guard carefully against giving more than you receive or you will find yourself doing without because you have helped someone else.","You love people, family, home, and friends and try to be a parent to the whole human race.","While you have generally stable conditions in your personal life, you may experience some problems in business affairs through a tendency to be scattering and inattentive to details.","While you find it easy to meet and mix, and can appear agreeable and compromising in conversation, you can become dogmatic and forceful if pressed too far.","Others learn that you cannot be told what to do and you seldom change your mind once it is made up.","You prefer situations that allow a degree of independence, but are reluctant to take on a demanding work-load or responsibility.","In a position dealing with the public, you could do well because of your friendly personality, interest in people, and desire to please.","When asked, you are able to give others good advice that you would probably not follow yourself, but must guard against being too opinionated in controversial matters.","You love the security of a home and family, you are fond of children, and, as a parent you would be fair and understanding.","Although you have good business judgment, you are not aggressive in your dealings because you do not like to create issues.","You would be successful in any position dealing with the public as you have a diplomatic and tactful manner and possess a charming, easy-going nature which puts people at ease.","People are drawn to you because they feel that you are patient, kind, understanding, and responsive.","You would be effective in a career or in volunteer work where you are handling people and serving in a humanitarian way.","While you are honest and responsible, one weakness that is paramount in your life is your lack of self-confidence and initiative, which causes you to put things off and avoid facing issues.","This name has given you a gregarious personality and a quick-thinking, creative, and versatile nature, but one that is unstable emotionally.","You desire change and travel and would enjoy opportunities that allowed you to be creative and to act independently, rather than to conform to system and routine.","However, this name does not allow you to complete your undertakings, as farther fields always look greener.","Although you may appear confident and positive, you actually lack confidence and feel self-conscious at times.","This name spoils patience and depth of thought, and weakens your stand in matters of principle.","You are too open to suggestion, and thus you could become involved in detrimental associations which could lead you into by-paths of thrill-seeking or emotional indulgence.","You gravitate to positions where there is stability, security and opportunities to work with others to make steady progress.","You could be very skilful in dealing with technical and mechanical matters.","You appreciate details, precision, and system and order.","These qualities, however, can make you too fussy, from time to time, over inconsequential matters.","You do not take to changes easily and can be quietly stubborn.","You do rely on the support and encouragement of others as there is an underlying lack of confidence with this name.","For the same reason, many times you procrastinate over making decisions.","Being clever, imaginative, and analytical, you do very well in the activities that hold your attention.","You long for freedom from restrictions and for outlets for your restless qualities, and cannot tolerate drudgery and monotony.","It is not easy for you to take advice, subsequently; you tend to work alone or independently.","You suffer inner turmoil and moods at times especially when you feel misunderstood, and being extremely sensitive, you are easily hurt and offended.","Your quiet intensity is difficult for others to understand and thus, you are on guard for fear of being ridiculed or criticized.","Loving the outdoors, you enjoy outside activities and the beauty of nature in its many facets.","Many people do not realize that you have a depth to your nature resulting from having thought a lot about life in many facets.","However, there is a tendency to assume too heavy a burden of responsibility for others, which leads to worry and undue concern.","People with problems are drawn to you as they recognize you as one who has understanding and gives not only sympathy and comfort but provides also some constructive advice or assistance.","You have a generous quality to your nature, but you must guard carefully against giving more than you receive or you will find yourself doing without because you have helped someone else.","You love people, family, home, and friends and try to be a parent to the whole human race.","While you have generally stable conditions in your personal life, you may experience some problems in business affairs through a tendency to be scattering and inattentive to details.","An intellectual, you have a deep appreciation for art, music, literature, and all the phenomena of nature.","You express your thoughts and feelings best through writing rather than verbally.","In fact, others find it challenging to understand you as you do not reveal your innermost thoughts unless you are completely comfortable in your friendships.","For that reason, despite having good business abilities, you like to work alone or where you are making your own decisions.","It has created separateness from others and loneliness in your life.","You appear quite confident outwardly, but you do suffer with lack of confidence at times and draw upon the support and encouragement of others.","Although you desire to create harmony in your associations, you can be too candid in your expression, especially if you are challenged by others.","Then you can be quietly stubborn and resist taking advice.","You want to be more expressive, diplomatic, and easy-going, but you feel the limitation in your communication with others and it creates frustration within you.","There is hardly anything you cannot do if you put your mind to it, but a driving urge leads you to one experience after another, seldom finishing what you start.","You cannot find peace of mind or lasting contentment in anything you do.","As soon as a challenge is met, boredom sets in, and you yearn for another experience.","This restlessness makes it difficult for you to assume responsibility and to establish stable, progressive conditions in your life.","You could do well in sales work or in meeting the public where quickness of mind and expression are all important.","You have many friends, but lose interest in people very quickly.","Your intense mental activity spoils system and concentration, and plays havoc with relaxation and sleep.","Out of your quick thinking has been borne hasty speech.","Acting on impulse instead of with forethought has led to many disappointments and bitter experiences.","You are responsible and generous, although somewhat scattering and disorganized at times.","Any jobs requiring systematic and conscientious effort, or involving any form of drudgery, dismay you.","In your work, you would seek a position offering self-expression through contact with people, such as sales or teaching, or a position giving scope to your creative, artistic talents.","You are good-natured and likeable, and people tend to confide in you and seek your advice in personal problems.","Others sense your sincere interest and desire to help, and you can always be counted on to see the bright side of any problem.","You enjoy making others happy and you never let your own problems \"get you down\" for any length of time, even though you do tend to worry too much at times.","Your optimism can be a source of inspiration to others as well as yourself.","In close personal relationships you are usually thoughtful and considerate.","However, your natural interest in others, coupled with your sympathetic reaction to problems, could draw you into emotional situations which may be difficult to get out of.","An intellectual, you have a deep appreciation for art, music, literature, and all the phenomena of nature.","You express your thoughts and feelings best through writing rather than verbally.","In fact, others find it challenging to understand you as you do not reveal your innermost thoughts unless you are completely comfortable in your friendships.","For that reason, despite having good business abilities, you like to work alone or where you are making your own decisions.","It has created separateness from others and loneliness in your life.","You can be lifted by beauty in all forms and you are at the most creative when inspired.","Your expressive, affectionate nature responds very quickly through your feelings, but you must guard against being possessive and jealous.","You feel and sense much that you do not fully understand and cannot express.","Your delight in mystery could draw you into occult studies or religions.","Unfortunately, uncontrolled thoughts make it difficult for you to retain emotional stability, and prevent you from finding proper peace and relaxation.","You tend to centre your interest too much on whatever means the most to you, and then you become over-possessive and suffer through disillusionment and fear of losses.","You desire all the finer things in life--lovely clothes, home, furniture, and environment.","However, procrastination is your worst enemy, and you find yourself lacking the ambition to make your dreams a reality.","People are inclined to take advantage of your sympathetic, tractable nature.","You naturally attract people with problems who seek your understanding and advice.","You can give good advice although it is unlikely that you would follow it yourself.","You would be most successful in situations where you can use your skills in diplomacy in handling people, but where you are not under pressure or required to carry responsibility and make decisions.","It is difficult for you to be individual and make your own decisions, for you lack self-confidence.","You stick stubbornly to your ideas or decisions, in spite of any appeals or advice; you are not willing to accept a compromise.","You prefer to be alone with your own thoughts, rather than in the company of others.","This name restricts spontaneity in association and the fluency of your verbal expression.","When you are required to express yourself in personal matters requiring finesse and diplomacy, you feel awkward and embarrassed.","Although you realize perfectly well what is expected of you, you are unable to find the right words, and hence you end up saying something inappropriate in a candid way.","You can express your deeper thoughts and feelings best through writing.","Your friendships and personal associations are rather restricted, being limited to those of a similar nature who can understand and accept your rather straightforward yet reserved manner.","You are steadfast and loyal, and do not allow gossip or anything belittling to be said against those whom you accept in friendship.","You find satisfaction in being outdoors or in getting out into nature, or in dealing with the products of the earth.","There is originality and depth of thought contained in this name, particularly along practical and mathematical lines.","You desire harmony and refinement in your environment and in all your personal associations.","Although mentally quick and intuitive in recognizing the thoughts and feelings of others, you experience a lack of fluency in verbal expression in responding.","Kind but shy, you appear calm but suffer inwardly from nervous tension that saps your strength.","As a result, you experience moods of depression and self-pity and often avoid facing issues.","A lack of confidence leads to procrastination, a need for support and encouragement from others, and a vulnerability to be taken advantage of in many situations.","Your idealistic and sensitive nature gives you a deep appreciation for the finer things of life and a strong desire to be of service to humanity.","There are times when you experience inner turbulence at your inability to say what you mean.","It is far easier for you to express your deeper thoughts and feelings through writing than verbally.","You find pleasure in literature, in poetry, and in your ideals and will turn to them when you feel you have been misunderstood.","You are deeply moved by the beauties of life, especially nature.","Because your feelings run deep, you must guard against the ups and downs, being very inspired one minute, then moody, reserved, and depressed the next.","Your reactions to people vary according to how you feel.","You tend to be secretive and noncommittal about private matters, yet at times you will talk effusively in order to hide your self-consciousness or to lead others away from personal subjects.","You are inspired by encouragement from others, yet suspicious of their intent.","You crave affection but seldom find anyone who understands your nature.","Your idealistic and sensitive nature gives you a deep

and loneliness in your life.","You have a versatile, restless nature, and could do any job well, although you would not like to do menial tasks.","You are seldom satisfied and are always seeking something new.","However, you do not know the meaning of relaxation, for when supposedly resting, your mind is forever active, planning out some new project or seeking new ways to improve your present enterprise.","You could organize the work of others, though in your impatience to see the job done efficiently, you would likely step right in and do it yourself.","You are self-expressive, philanthropic, clever, and ambitious.","You like to specialize in whatever you undertake.","This name gives you an optimistic outlook on life.","You appreciate good quality in all things and want the best money can buy.","You have big ideals and dreams about the things you would like but you are not always willing to put forth the necessary effort, particularly if it means being subservient to others or having to work in an unimportant, menial capacity.","Position and means are important to you and, in order to create this impression of affluence, you will spend even when it is not prudent to do so.","You like to give the impression that you have everything under control.","You must learn to be tolerant of the weaknesses of others and be fair in your judgment, not measuring from your standard of practical thinking but recognizing the needs of others.","You are generally good-natured, but may suffer with feelings of self-pity, particularly if your financial success is limited.","You have a bubbling, spontaneous nature and a happy-go-lucky outlook which helps smooth the pathway of life.","Also you are sympathetic to the needs of others.","Interested in art, music, singing, dancing, and anything of an artistic nature, you could become a very fine performer.","Your spontaneous expression stands you in good stead during arguments or debates, though you are perhaps too outspoken and inclined to sarcasm.","A very real weakness of this name is lack of system and order.","The use of this name makes it extremely difficult to carry through and finish the things you start.","It is easy to make promises in an effort to make others happy, although not so easy to keep them.","You spend your money recklessly, seldom reckoning whether you can afford to be so generous.","All the finer things of life and beauties of nature are an inspiration to you and you are attracted to the mysteries of nature.","Difficulty in expression results in your being too positive, blunt, and candid in speech and although you are easily offended by others, you do not show it.","You crave affection and understanding, but rarely find it as others do not understand you and accuse you of being cool and aloof.","The average person would never realize the true depth of your nature.","A very individual, independent person, you live within your own thoughts.","The insecurity you experience from limited verbal expression and social ease results in a jealous possessiveness and suffering through frustration, repressed emotion, and self-consciousness.","You love

monotony, with the result that you leave many things unfinished.","Your name has taken you into many bitter experiences.","The greatest lack in your life is stability and peace of mind.","A peaceful and quiet environment, especially out in nature, is one of your greatest desires, but you are constantly taken into chaotic conditions.","Because you have high ideals and are a principled person, you have been disillusioned and disappointed in people on many occasions and have experienced much aloneness.","You are fond of outdoor sports, where you can find an outlet for your nervous energy.","Impulsiveness could bring frequent accidents and unfortunate happenings into your life.","You do not like to be restricted or to have your freedom curtailed in any way.","You find it

living.","You feel that it is important to convey the impression that you are financially secure, and you place importance on your mode of dress, and on appearances generally.","While you could do well in certain positions of authority, you have a certain lack of initiative and a tendency to procrastinate.","Difficulty in coming to important decisions and a degree of passivity do not allow you the concentration and application required to attain positions of responsibility.","You prefer to choose the easiest way to accomplish your goals, and would probably readily admit that you dislike hard work.","However, your likeable personality sees you through most situations but when your emotional nature does not allow you to be strictly impersonal in your relationships, you could experience awkward, embarrassing entanglements.","It gives you a creative ability in art, music, singing, or fancywork and an appreciation for refined surroundings.","Your sociable nature expresses affection, kindness, and thoughtfulness to the extent that it is difficult for you not to be affected by others and governed by your emotions, rather than by logic and reason.","As you respond to love and encouragement from others, your romantic and dreamy nature can easily lead you into love affairs.","Your desire for peace at any price can result in going out of your way to avoid arguments and confrontation or hurting the feelings of others.","Also, budgeting can be a problem as you enjoy spending money and can easily ignore being practical.","Your ideas can be very original and

enthusiasm, aggressiveness, and salesmanship are often sufficient to bring about fulfillment of your ambitions.","However, in the attempt to impress others with the scope of your success, you can over-extend your resources to the point that you have inadequate means to cover your basic expenses.","There are times when you would be advised to start in a smaller way, and gradually reach your desired level of success through perseverance, patience, and attention to details.","When things are going well, you have a generous, magnanimous nature, ready to offer support and assistance to others.","When under stress, you can become overbearing and belittling in your attitude to others, and inclined to express sarcasm and temper.","Should you become too inwardly focussed on your own
